## Definition: addition, scalar multiplication
- An addition on a set $V$ is a function that assigns an element $u + v \in V$ to each pair of elements $u, v \in V$.
- A scalar multiplication on a set $V$ is a function that assigns an element $\lambda v \in V$ to each $\lambda \in \mathbf{F}$ and each $v \in V$.

## Definition: vector space
A _vector space_ is a set $V$ along with an addition on $V$ and a scalar multiplication on $V$ such that the following properties hold.
- commutativity
- associativity
- additive identity
- additive inverse
- multiplicative identity
- distributive properties

## Definition: vector, point
Elements of a vector space are called _vectors_ or _points_.

## Definition: real vector space, complex vector space
- A vector space over $\mathbf{R}$ is called a real vector space.
- A vector space over $\mathbf{C}$ is called a complex vector space.

## Exercises
### Suppose $a \in \mathbf{F}, v \in V \wedge av = 0$. Prove that $a = 0 \vee v = 0$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
1. \text{ If } a = 0  \\
av = 0v = 0 \text{, which satisfies the disjunction}\\[0.6em]
2. \text{ If } a\neq 0 \\
av = 0 \\
a^{-1}(av) = 0 \\
1v = 0 \\
v = 0 \\[0.6em]
\text{The only possibilities are } a = 0 \ \vee \ a \neq 0, \text{ and int he second case } v = 0. \\
\text{Thus } av = 0 \Longrightarrow a = 0 \ \vee \ v = 0 \quad \blacksquare
\end{array}
$$
